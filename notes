#using scanf in programs is dangerous as there is chances for buffer overrun. 
 better option to use is fgets(*ptr,size,stdin) since it specifies how many chars  to read exactly.
 also fgets will leave the input buffer intact after reading the specified number of characters.Never use gets(). 
 Because it is impossible to tell without knowing the data in advance how many characters gets() will read, 
 and because gets() will continue to store characters past the end of the buffer, it is extremely dangerous to use. 
 It has been used to break computer security. Use fgets() instead.

#we can use scanf("%[^\n]s",str) to read until \n is encounterd . this can also read strings with space

#the scanf scheme above was not working when two successive scanf are performed.

#integer array must be memset before using. Saw once case that one position in array was containing some garbage value. this is contrary to what studied in college that array elements will be 0 during initialization. 
this initialization thing should be remembered.everything incl array.
automatic variables => contain junk (not initialized)
global variables    => initialized to zero
static variables    => initialized to zero if not initialized.
int b[10] = {0};   //this is also valid instead of memset.
