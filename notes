#using scanf in programs is dangerous as there is chances for buffer overrun. 
 better option to use is fgets(*ptr,size,stdin) since it specifies how many chars  to read exactly.also fgets will leave the input buffer intact after reading the specified number of characters.

#we can use scanf("%[^\n]s",str) to read until \n is encounterd . this can also read strings with space
